      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm Louis Ke, a dedicated Grade 12 student with a passion for web development and design. My journey into coding began two years ago, and since then, I've been constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies to create meaningful digital experiences.</p>
      
      <p>I believe in the power of clean, semantic code and user-centered design. Every project I work on is an opportunity to solve problems, learn something new, and create something that makes a difference. I'm particularly interested in front-end development, responsive design, and creating accessible websites that work beautifully for everyone.</p>
      
      <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest design trends, contributing to open-source projects, or helping fellow students learn to code. I'm always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate with others who share my passion for technology and innovation.</p>
